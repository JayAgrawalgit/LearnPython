# In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct lists using the "append" list method.
# You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" list, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings variable.
# You will also have to fill in the variable second_name with the second name in the names list, using the brackets operator [].
# Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.
numbers = []
strings = []
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

# write your code here
second_name = None


# this code should write out the filled arrays and the second name in the names list (Eric).
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)
