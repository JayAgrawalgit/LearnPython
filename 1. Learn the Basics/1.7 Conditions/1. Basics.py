# Python uses boolean variables to evaluate conditions.
# The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated. For example:
x = 2
print(x == 2) # prints out True
print(x == 3) # prints out False
print(x < 3) # prints out True
print(x != 2) # prints out False
# Notice that variable assignment is done using a single equals operator "=",
# whereas comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==".
# The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".
