Here are some basic argument specifiers you should know:

%s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

%d - Integers

%f - Floating point numbers

%.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.
example:
 x = 5
 print("value of x is %.5f" % x)
 output : value of x is 5.00000
