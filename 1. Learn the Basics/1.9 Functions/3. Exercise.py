# In this exercise you'll use an existing function, and while adding your own to create a fully functional program.
# Add a function named list_benefits() that returns the following list of strings:
# "More organized code", "More readable code", "Easier code reuse",
# "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"
# Add a function named build_sentence(info) which receives a single argument containing a string and returns
# a sentence starting with the given string and ending with the string " is a benefit of functions!"
# Run and see all the functions work together!

# Modify this function to return a list of strings as defined above
def list_benefits():
    pass

# Modify this function to concatenate to each benefit - " is a benefit of functions!"
def build_sentence(benefit):
    pass
