# Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks,
# allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time.
# Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.

# How do you write functions in Python?
# As we have seen on previous tutorials, Python makes use of blocks.
# A block is a area of code of written in the format of:
# block_head:
#     1st block line
#     2nd block line
#     ...
# Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format:
# block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".
# Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name.
# For example:
def my_function():
    print("Hello From My Function!")        # declaration

# Functions may also receive arguments (variables passed from the caller to the function). For example:
def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
    print("Hello, %s , From My Function!, I wish you %s"%(username, greeting))

# Functions may return a value to the caller, using the keyword- 'return' . For example:
def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
