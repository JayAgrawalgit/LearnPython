# Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:
helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
print(helloworld)
# output: hello world


# Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
print(lotsofhellos)
# output:hellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohellohello
