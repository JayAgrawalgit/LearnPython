# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)
# output:[1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8]


# Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
print([1,2,3] * 3)
# output:[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
