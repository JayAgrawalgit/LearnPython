# # For loops iterate over a given sequence. Here is an example:
# primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
# for prime in primes:
#     print(prime)

# For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions.
# The difference between range and xrange is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specified
# range, whereas xrange returns an iterator, which is more efficient. (Python 3 uses the range function,
# which acts like xrange). Note that the range function is zero based.

# Prints out the numbers 0,1,2,3,4
for x in range(5):
    print(x)

# Prints out 3,4,5
for x in range(3, 6):
    print(x)

# Prints out 3,5,7
for x in range(3, 8, 2):
    print(x)
